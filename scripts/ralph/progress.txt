## Completed Stories

### Phase 1: Contracts ✅
- [x] CON-001: BarrelToken ERC20 (mintable, 18 decimals)
- [x] CON-002: BarrelVault treasury (trade execution, DEX integration)
- [x] CON-003: BarrelConsensus improvements (slash/reward, cooldowns)
- [x] CON-004: Foundry tests (20 tests passing)

### Phase 2: Agents ✅
- [x] AGT-001: Pyth price feeds (ETH/BTC/SOL)
- [x] AGT-002: X/sentiment via xAI API
- [x] AGT-003: Nad.fun launch detection (event watching)
- [x] AGT-004: Contract interaction layer (viem)
- [x] AGT-005: Orchestrator with full data flow

---

## Learnings

### Contracts
- Foundry forge-std v1.14.0 requires explicit install
- 66% quorum means consensus can trigger before all agents vote
- Slash mechanics create real consequences for bad calls

### Agents
- viem requires explicit chain in writeContract calls
- Pyth API returns price with exponent, needs parsing
- xAI x_search is agentic (server-side reasoning loop)
- Keep TypeScript types loose for external API responses

## Test Results
